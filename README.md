# 🤖 Autonomous AI Agent with LangChain

An intelligent, reasoning-capable AI agent built using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) that performs dynamic task planning, document retrieval, tool usage, and real-time iteration. The agent can orchestrate tasks like web scraping, summarization, and API calls with the ability to reflect, correct, and rerun tasks intelligently.



## 🧠 Features

- ✅ **Dynamic Reasoning & Planning**
- 🔍 **Web Search & Document Retrieval**
- 🧾 **Summarization & Report Generation**
- 🔗 **API Integration & Tool Chaining**
- 🛠️ **Custom Tool Creation with LangChain Runnables**
- 💡 **Self-Correcting Iteration Loop**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🧠 **LangChain**
- 💬 **OpenAI / HuggingFace LLMs**
- 📜 **Python (Jupyter / Google Colab)**
- 🌐 **Web Scraping / API Calls**
- 🪝 **Custom Tools + LangChain Runnables**

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🧩 1. Tool Initialization
Custom tools are defined to handle external data like:
- Web scraping
- PDF/text parsing
- API data fetching

### 🪄 2. Workflow Composition
LangChain Runnables & Chains are composed to create a robust execution pipeline:
- Task planner
- Retriever
- Summarizer
- Responder

### 🔁 3. Iteration & Self-Correction
Output is validated, and if deemed incorrect or incomplete, the agent triggers a correction path and retries intelligently.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheBadshahKid/Autonomous-AI-Agent.git
cd Autonomous-AI-Agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

## 🧪 Usage

Run the notebook or `main.py` file after setting up your environment variables/API keys.

```bash
python main.py
```

Or open `Autonomous_Agent_Demo.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter.

---

## 🔐 Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file to store your API keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_hf_key
```

## 📈 Future Improvements

* [ ] GUI integration (e.g., Streamlit or Flask)
* [ ] Long-term memory with vector DBs (like FAISS or Chroma)
* [ ] Agent benchmarking on real-world tasks
* [ ] Dockerized deployment
